# Vue Playground

Goal of this repo is to learn Vue. Here are some of the main concepts I want to explore:
- Attribute Binding
    - image in basic1
- Conditional Rendering
    - no todos in list
- List Rendering
    - todos
- Event Handling
    - todo click handler
- Class & Style Binding
    - we've changed styling if it is completed
- Computed Properties
    - title and image
- Components
    - todo-component
- Communicating Events
    - emit event in todo
- Forms
    - Todo form and name form
- Event Bus
    - separate app

I will be building a very basic ToDo app.
